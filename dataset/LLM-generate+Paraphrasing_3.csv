"The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), for example, requires all organisations to be responsible for personal information in their possession or custody, including information that has been transferred to a third party for processing.",SE
"Organisations hosting components of the EHRi, should assess, by means of a Privacy Impact Assessment, the risks to personal privacy associated with implementation of the hosted components and should implement appropriate privacy controls to mitigate identified risks.",SE
"Comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessments need to address such issues as privacy risk management, record linkages, and security safeguards.",SE
"To satisfy this legal requirement, healthcare organisations must identify the purposes for which they collect, use and disclose a patient or person's PHI.",SE
"The goal is to make a reasonable effort to ensure that patients or persons understand the purposes for which organisations connected to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi collect, use and disclose their PHI.24",SE
"However, the novelty of the EHR and the anxiety it can arouse about the protection of privacy interests make it imperative that patients or persons be informed, in an appropriate way, of the prospective uses and disclosures of their personal information.",SE
Organisations connecting to the EHRi or organisations hosting components of the EHRi should only collect PHI necessary to fulfill the purposes that they have identified (see Privacy Requirement 5).,SE
"Rationale: The ultimate goal is to have no secret, or unspecified, collections, uses or disclosures of personal information held in an EHRi or in POS systems connected to the EHRi.",SE
"Such patients or persons have a right to know what uses and disclosures, in particular, are mandated by law, such as for mandatory reporting of infectious diseases or suspected child abuse or for law enforcement.",SE
"Laws may require express, implied or deemed consent for specific collections, uses and disclosures of PHI.",SE
"Express consent includes any action by a patient or person or their authorized representative (e.g. parent, guardian or substitute decision maker) specifically to authorize the collection, use or disclosure of personal information (e.g. a signature, a check-off box, a verbal approval).",SE
"The assumption of reasonableness usually rests on how well the patient or person was informed about the intended collection, use, or disclosure of his or her personal information.",SE
"An organisation should be able to demonstrate that it complied with applicable legislative requirements and that the patient or person had a reasonable opportunity to know that information was going to be collected and used for specific purposes and persisted with the action that resulted in the information flow.26, 27",SE
"It is assumed that based on jurisdictional requirements for consent that at least some POS systems connected to the EHRi may eventually have specific ""consent fields"" that will allow POS users to enter or ""check-off""how consent was obtained, withdrawn or revoked in those cases where consent was required for specific activities.",SE
The EHRi must reflect legal obligations in its privacy requirements in all of their relative sophistication in this novel area.,SE
"The ultimate obligation is to meet the wishes of the patient or person, in those circumstances where he or she is able to place express instructions on the allowable uses and disclosures of his or her PHI.29",SE
"In addition to meeting these legal requirements, healthcare organisations should also seek to meet high ethical and moral standards for information consent, which is vital to the protection of privacy as an aspect of human dignity and the protection of human rights.",SE
"It is important to note that a patient or person may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions.",SE
"The POS system has to ensure that those accessing this PHI only obtain access to information that is legitimately available on the basis of consent or legal authorization to use or disclose (e.g., auditing or law enforcement).",SE
"Consequently, those organisations wishing to disclose PHI to another jurisdiction must do so in a manner that respects the legal requirements for consent in their own jurisdiction (i.e. the jurisdiction of the disclosing organisation).",SE
"As a practical matter, a healthcare organisation wishing to access PHI from another jurisdiction must do so in a manner that respects the legal requirements for consent to disclose PHI in the jurisdiction of the organisation that holds the data as well as satisfy all the legal requirements for consent to access PHI in its own jurisdiction.",SE
Information contained within a patient or person's EHR may carry with it the legal requirements for consent from multiple jurisdictions (see Privacy Requirement 12).,SE
"Furthermore, some health data protection legislation requires that health information custodians notify a patient or person if his or her information is stolen, lost, or accessed by unauthorized persons.38 The individual(s) responsible for facilitating an organisation's privacy compliance will be greatly assisted in determining when a potential ""unauthorized""access or disclosure of PHI has taken place if they are notified when an individual's consent directives are overridden.",SE
"As logs will themselves contain confidential information, they must be made both secure and tamper-proof.",SE
"In addition to logging overrides of a patient or person's consent directives (Item b in the list above) and alerting accountable individuals that a consent override has occurred (item c in the list above), there is also a related requirement to notify patients or persons when access has been deemed inappropriate (see Privacy Requirement 20).",SE
"Healthcare providers require all relevant PHI from a patient or person's medical history in order to definitively diagnose and safely treat a patient or person. Therefore, when patients or persons request that their healthcare provider mask or lock components of their PHI, it may not be possible for their healthcare team to provide appropriate care.",SE
"Where required to do so by law ,the EHRi and POS systems connected to the EHRi must have the ability to indicate when consent is given on behalf of a patient or person by a substitute decision maker (e.g. consent given by an authorized representative), as well as identify this substitute decision maker and the substitute decision maker's relation to the patient or person.",SE
"Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must not, as a condition of the supply of a service, require a patient or person to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of PHI beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes.",SE
"As such, rules for collection, use and disclosure should be strictly delineated and observed because patients will often not object to certain PHI collections, uses and disclosures in light of ""vulnerable""health circumstances.",SE
"In the rare circumstances where a patient withdraws or withholds consent and the healthcare provider believes that care cannot be provided safely, the healthcare provider may determine that it is appropriate to refuse to provide treatment.42",SE
"As outlined in Privacy Requirement 5, organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi should limit collection of PHI to that which is necessary for the identified purposes.",SE
PHI should not be collected indiscriminately.,SE
"A caveat is that healthcare providers may collect any information deemed relevant to the purposes stated to patients or persons and then ensure that it is only used and disclosed on a """"need to know"""" basis.",SE
"Organisations connecting to the EHRi, and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must not collect PHI by misleading or deceiving patients or persons or healthcare providers about the purposes for which information is being collected.",SE
"When organisations identify the purposes for which they collect PHI (Privacy Requirement 5) and seek the appropriate consent for these purposes (Privacy Requirement 8), it is imperative that they then only use, disclose and retain information for these purposes.",SE
"Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must only use or disclose PHI for purposes consistent with those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the patient or person or as permitted or required by law.46",SE
"Rationale: The Alberta Health Information Protection Act, Manitoba Personal Health Information Protection Act and Ontario Personal Health Information Act all require that custodians of PHI only collect, use or disclose as much PHI as is reasonably necessary to carry out the identified purposes.",SE
These requirements will greatly assist in operationalizing the limitation of use and disclosure of this PH to authorized users with appropriate roles and privileges.,SE
"Logs of access, modification and disclosure will themselves contain confidential information and must therefore be made both secure and tamper-proof.",SE
"The goal for healthcare organisations is to have PHI that is sufficiently accurate, complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate PHI may be used to make a decision about a patient or person.",SE
Rationale: An electronic health record environment should facilitate the achievement of better quality records by building in automatic checks on data entry and making it easier to update even the most basic demographic and location information on any patient or person.,SE
"In addition, it is of critical importance for patient safety and a number of other reasons, including the overall success of the EHRS, that EHRi users accurately identify patients or persons prior to accessing or modifying their PHI.",SE
"Concern for physical and system security has always been at the core of data protection and it will be of special importance in a developed electronic health record system, since the risks of a breach of security can be so devastating for the patient or person.",SE
The EHRi must provide functions for marking records of selected patients or persons52 and subsequently making accesses to such data subject to mandatory auditing by the individual accountable for privacy compliance in the organisation.,SE
It may therefore be prudent to place additional audit controls on these records to protect patient privacy.,SE
The EHRi should recognize this practical reality and facilitate the rapid and regular audit of access to these records (perhaps involving notification to a privacy officer on each access).,SE
"Rather, the requirement ensures that the capability exists to rapidly identify prurient interest by users who lack a legitimate need-to-know.",SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must ensure that privacy education and training and regular updates in organisational privacy policies and procedures are provided to each permanent or temporary employee or third-party contractor who is a registered user of a POS connected to the EHRi or who has access to hosted components of the EHRi.,SE
"The intent of this section is to make it possible for concerned members of the public to know the purposes for collecting, using, and disclosing PHI about them.",SE
Privacy oversight bodies (e.g. Information and Privacy Commissioners) may also want assurance that healthcare organisations have privacy management plans in place.,SE
"It is now well established that patients have a legal right of access to their own health information, subject to limited exceptions in specified circumstances.53",SE
"For example, note that under the Alberta Health Information Act, a health information custodian that discloses PHI must make a note of the name of the person to whom the custodian disclosed the information; the date and purpose of the disclosure; and a description of the information disclosed.",SE
"a) inform a patient or person of the existence, use and disclosure60 of his or her PHI and shall give the patient or person direct access to that PHI where such access is not prohibited by legislation;61",SE
c) allow a patient or person to challenge the accuracy and completeness of his or her PHI and have it amended as appropriate.,SE
Patients or persons thus have a right to check that the information being used to treat them is accurate.,SE
"As discussed further below, the patient or person also has a right to challenge factual errors in particular (see Privacy Requirement 25).",SE
"Some corrections, deletions, or amendments will have a particular relevance to the ongoing healthcare of a patient or person, and they should be made known appropriately.63 Fortunately, a developed electronic health record system will automatically distribute the most up to date information when it is required for authorized purposes.",SE
"Organisations connecting to the EHRi, and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must give patients or persons the right to address a challenge concerning compliance with these requirements to the designated individual or individuals specified in Privacy Requirement 1.",SE
Rationale: To give effect to privacy requirements like Privacy Requirement 3 and Privacy Requirement 7 patients must be able to challenge an organisation's compliance with those requirements.,SE
a) put easily accessible and simple-to-use procedures in place to receive and respond to complaints or inquiries about their policies and practices relating to the handling of PHI;,SE
b) inform complainants and inquirers of the existence of these procedures,SE
c) treat all received complaints as confidential.,SE
"Even if healthcare organisations seek to manage complaints locally and internally by sophisticated mechanisms for their resolution, they should still inform complainants if they have a right to make a privacy complaint to the provincial or territorial Information and Privacy Commissioner (or equivalent).64",SE
Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must investigate all privacy related complaints.,SE
"If a complaint is found to be justified, the EHRi, organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi should take appropriate measures, including, if necessary, amending their policies and practices and notifying the complainant of actions taken.",SE
"Since so many aspects of data protection are now regulated by detailed laws and regulations, a number of complaints will be answered by informing the complainant of what the law requires an organisation to do in specific circumstances.",SE
"-a security policy must be created, promulgated and enforced by administrative and technical means (see section 5.3);",SE
"-privacy, security and business continuity risks must be analysed by means of a Threat and Risk Assessment (see section 5.2) and those risks must be managed against the objectives set by the security policy;",SE
-compliance with the security policy must be assessed on an ongoing basis (see section 5.13);,SE
"-privacy, security and business continuity risks must be re-analysed when significant changes are made to the components of the EHRi that the organisation is hosting (see section 5.2).",SE
An organisation needs to implement a risk management process within the organisation.,SE
This process needs to have the support and commitment of the highest levels of management within the organisation; otherwise it will be difficult to implement and to enforce.,SE
Responsibilities for information risk management throughout the organisation will need to be assigned.,SE
Key organisational objectives in matters related to information risk management will need to be defined.,SE
"Risk management processes will then need to be put in place to assess, manage and mitigate risk on an ongoing basis.",SE
An essential step in mitigating risks associated with information systems such as the EHRi is to perform a threat and risk assessment.,SE
Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must -and origanisations connecting to the EHRi should -assess threats and risks to these components by careful review of a Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA).,SE
"b) an assessment, for each information asset, of how critical it will be to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the asset, and accountability for the asset;",SE
"c) a vulnerability analysis, including a comprehensive listing of the privacy and security vulnerabilities of the hosted EHRi components a listing of the actual or planned safeguards that can protect against those vulnerabilities;",SE
d) a risk analysis that determines the residual risk after actual or planned safeguards are put in place;,SE
e) a recommendation of whether residual risk is to be:,SE
"i) further reduced (by adding specific safeguards to the system or scaling back system functionality),",SE
"ii) transferred to a third party, or",SE
iii) accepted by the organisation.,SE
The results will determine priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing controls selected to protect against these risks.,SE
"ISO or IEC 17799 considers security policy to be an essential tool in providing a clear, written framework from which to effectively implement and administer IT security.",SE
"Organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi must have a written IT security policy that is approved by management, published, and communicated to all employees and relevant external parties.",SE
2)maintain the security of organisational information processing facilities and information assets accessed by third parties; and,SE
3)maintain the security of information when the responsibility for information processing has been outsourced to another organisation.,SE
a) clearly define and assign information security responsibilities; and,SE
b) ensure that Information security activities relating to the EHRi are co-ordinated by representatives from different parts of the organisation who have relevant roles and job functions.,SE
-performing security assessments and evaluating the organisation's information security risks (see Security Requirement 1);,SE
-developing appropriate security policies (see Security Requirement 2);,SE
"-architecting, implementing and monitoring an enterprise wide information security program ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and the integrity and availability of systems;",SE
-developing and implementing security awareness training programs (see Security Requirement 16);,SE
"-assessing, building and managing an effective information security department ;",SE
-managing expense budgets for IT security services and capital expenditures;,SE
"-establishing protocols to proactively test and protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information enterprise wide within the context of the organisation's privacy and security policies;",SE
-maintaining effective business continuity and disaster recovery plans (see Security Requirement 86); and,SE
Organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi must have the implementation of their information security policy either: a) reviewed independently; or b) attested to in a written declaration by the organisation's chief executive officer or board of directors.,SE
PHI flowing from one jurisdiction to another must do so in an environment where a minimum level of protection is afforded regardless of which jurisdiction the information finds itself.,SE
"Third party review can and should occur at many levels: policy reviews, organisational IT security reviews, EHRi-wide Threat and Risk Assessments, TRAs for specific systems, security architecture reviews, technical system testing such as vulnerability testing, and compliance audits against policies and procedures.",SE
"Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must assess, by means of threat and risk analysis, the risks associated with access by external parties to hosted components or to facilities management by external parties and must implement appropriate security controls where necessary to mitigate identified risks.",SE
a) outsourcing management or control of all or some part of EHRi hosted components;,SE
b) third-party facilities management for EHRi hosted components; or.,SE
c) access to the EHRi by third parties.,SE
The objectives of information asset management is to achieve and maintain appropriate protection of organisational assets.,SE
"c)have rules governing the acceptable use of these assets that are identified, documented, and put into practice.",SE
Because one cannot predict the sensitivity of a given element of PHI through all its uses and phases of its life cycle that all PHI should be subject to careful protection at all times.,SE
Identifying and (where appropriate) protectively labelling information assets as confidential can be an important tool in staff training and awareness.,SE
All data contained within a patient or person's EHR is to be considered confidential and its confidentiality uniformly protected.,SE
"This is especially important where the information is contained in email, faxes or other documents which may contain a mixture of confidential and non-confidential information.",SE
"1)reduce risks of human error, theft, fraud or misuse of facilities;",SE
"2)ensure that users are aware of information security threats and concerns, and are equipped to support the corporate security policy in the course of their normal work;",SE
3)minimize the damage from security incidents and malfunctions; and,SE
"All organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi should document in job definitions the security roles and responsibilities of staff who are registered users of healthcare applications accessible via the EHRi, as laid down in the organisation's information security policy.",SE
These roles must be defined in a standardised or harmonized manner so as to ensure future interoperability of authentication services between POS systems and the EHRi.,SE
"All organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi must include in the terms and conditions of employment of employees (permanent, part-time or contracted) who are, or will be, users of POS systems connected to the EHRi, a statement about the employee's responsibility for information security and privacy.",SE
Terms of Employment involving maintaining confidentiality should survive employment termination (see provisions for confidentiality agreements in Security Requirement 15).,SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must verify the identity and address of each permanent or temporary staff member or contractor who will become a registered user of a POS connected to the EHRi or who will have access to hosted components of the EHRi.,SE
A simple verification of name and address from reliable identification documents (driver's license for example) suffices to meet the requirement.,SE
"Such verification of identity documents helps to ensure that effective prosecution or litigation can be brought against individuals who can be shown, as a result of analyzing audit logs, to have abused their access privileges.",SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must obtain a signed confidentiality agreement from each permanent or temporary staff member or contractor who is a registered user of a POS connected to the EHRi or who has access to hosted components of the EHRi as part of his or her initial terms and conditions of employment.,SE
Confidentiality agreements need to be carefully worded to comply with jurisdictional requirements.,SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must ensure that information security education and training and regular updates in organisational security policies and procedures are provided to each permanent or temporary employee or third-party contractor who is a registered user of a POS connected to the EHRi or who has access to hosted components of the EHRi.,SE
"All users need to be made aware of the confidentiality of PHI, and the procedures required for maintaining this confidentiality.",SE
"As well, users should be made aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of information that refers to identifiable healthcare providers.",SE
"Rationale: Effective termination of user access privileges is a minimum requirement but in the absence of single sign-on capabilities and shared authentication services, it is not always effectually handled.",SE
"Termination of user access privileges will also include termination of digital signatures (see ""Security Requirement 79 Providing Digital Signatures for Users"").",SE
"1)prevent unauthorized access, damage and interference to business premises and information;",SE
"2)prevent loss, damage or compromise of assets and interruption to business activities; and",SE
3)prevent compromise or theft of information and information processing facilities.,SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must use security perimeters to protect areas that contain information processing facilities supporting EHRi servers, applications or data.",SE
These secure areas must be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access.,SE
Rationale: Perimeter security of servers and other aspects of application hosting is a minimum requirement for ensuring the availability and integrity of these important applications and data and for ensuring the confidentiality of information in storage that is not already secured cryptographically.,SE
"In turn, controlling access is a minimum requirement of perimeter security.",SE
"The most detailed provisions are found in Manitoba's health information legislation, which require the trustee to ensure that PHI is maintained in a designated area or areas that is subject to appropriate security safeguards; and to limit physical access to designated areas to authorized persons.",SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must protect sites and equipment supporting the EHRi to reduce the risks from environmental threats and hazards.,SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must protect equipment supporting the EHRi from power failures and other disruptions caused by failures in supporting utilities.,SE
Rationale: This is a minimum requirement for protecting system availability in the 24 by 7 operational environment of healthcare.,SE
"Healthcare demands high system availability, especially in those instances where disruptions of supporting utilities are caused by disasters that themselves result in injuries and therefore place a heavy burden on emergency health services.",SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must ensure that equipment supporting the EHRi: 1) is not used outside their premises without appropriate safeguards and prior authorization by the organisation's management, and 2) is repaired or serviced by authorized personnel only.",SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must securely overwrite or else destroy all media containing EHRi application software, PHI, or security critical system data when no longer required for use.",SE
"Legal requirements follow from the Manitoba regulations pursuant to Personal Health Information Act: ""to ensure the security of PHI in electronic form when the computer hardware or removable electronic storage media on which it has been recorded is being disposed of or used for another purpose"".",SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must not allow equipment, data or software supporting the EHRi to be removed without authorization by the organisation's management.",SE
1)ensure the correct and secure operation of information processing facilities;,SE
2)minimize the risk of systems failures;,SE
3)protect the integrity of software and information;,SE
4)maintain the integrity and availability of information processing and communication;,SE
5)ensure the safeguarding of information in networks and the protection of the supporting infrastructure;,SE
6)prevent damage to assets and interruptions to business activities; and,SE
"7)prevent loss, modification or misuse of information exchanged between organisations.",SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must control changes to information processing facilities and systems that support the EHRi by means of a formal and structured change control process to ensure the appropriate control of host applications and systems.,SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must separate the development and testing environments for those EHRi components from the operational environments for those components.,SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must monitor capacity demands and project future capacity requirements to ensure adequate processing power and storage will be made available to host those EHRi components.,SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must implement appropriate detection and prevention controls and appropriate user awareness procedures to protect against malicious software (viruses, worms, etc.)",SE
"Security Requirement 30 Securely Backing Up Data All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must back up PHI and security critical system data in a manner that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data ; and b) store the backed-up data in a physically secure environment off-site (see section 5.7).",SE
Manitoba's health information legislation requires a trustee who uses electronic means to request disclosure and to respond to requests for disclosure to implement procedures to prevent the interception of information by unauthorized persons.,SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must - and organisations connecting to the EHRi should - ensure that PHI and other security critical data stored on removable media are: a) encrypted while the media are in transit to protect the data's confidentiality and integrity; and Admin Requirement Tech Requirement b) protected from theft, where appropriate, while the media are in transit to protect the data's availability.",SE
"All organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi should destroy, permanently erase or make anonymous PHI contained on media that are no longer required.",SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must protect electronic media containing PHI or security critical system data, including user registration data, by one or more of the following means:",SE
a) physically protecting the media in accordance with Security Requirement 18;,SE
b) securely de-identifying the PHI it contains; or,SE
c) encrypting the data it contains.,SE
Protection of user registration data is essential to maintaining its integrity (and hence the integrity of the user authentication process).,SE
"While physical protection of data storage will always be essential (to protect system availability), de-identification and encryption should be seriously considered in the design of any new system.",SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must monitor the status and location of media containing unencrypted EHRi data or security critical data, including user registration data, and ensure this data remains physically protected.",SE
Information exchange agreements should be executed between (among) jurisdictions operating EHRi components prior to PHI flowing across provincial or territorial borders.,SE
Such agreements would clarify the mutual custodial responsibilities of jurisdictions with relation to PHI.,SE
"Of all security requirements protecting PHI, one of the most important is audit and logging.",SE
These ensure accountability for patients or persons entrusting their information to electronic health record systems and also ensure that users will conform to policies on acceptable use of the EHRi.,SE
"Audit records should contain the necessary information to answer the following questions: 1)For a given user, what PHI did they access, create or update and when? 2)or a given element of PHI, what users have accessed, created or updated it and when?",SE
"1) A trustee shall ensure every electronic information system that the trustee designs or acquires after December 11, 2000: a) produces an electronic record of every successful or unsuccessful attempt to i) gain access to the personal health information maintained on the system, ii) add to, delete or modify the personal health information maintained on the system; and",SE
"To construct an authoritative transcript of which users have accessed a patient or person's PHI or what PHI a user has accessed, all audit records will need to be accessible and hence audit requirements meeting the strictest existing jurisdictional legal requirements are essential to support full interoperability across jurisdictions.",SE
Rationale: Such an audit log allows reconstruction of the state of any EHR stored within the POS system at any point in time.,SE
The EHRi may be required to keep a record of all cross-jurisdictional transfers of PHI.,SE
"For example, Alberta's health information legislation requires a custodian that discloses PHI to make a note of the name of the person to whom the custodian disclosed the information; the date and purpose of the disclosure; and a description of the information disclosed.",SE
"All POS systems connected to the EHRi must record in an audit log every instance of a user accessing, updating, or archiving PHI.",SE
"All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must retain75 the audit log for the entire retention period of the records audited, to enable investigations to be carried out when necessary and to provide evidence where necessary.",SE
Rationale: This requirement mandates that automated tools actively look for anomalous patterns of access.,SE
Such active intrusion detection is an essential feature of robust security systems.,SE
"Unlike audit logging itself, the analysis tools need not be continuously available.",SE
It suffices that such tools be available when needed.,SE
Need will be determined by system design and by appropriate Threat and Risk Analysis.,SE
The EHRi must be capable of identifying of all users who have accessed or modified a given patient's or person's record(s) over a given period of time. Rationale: This requirement is intended to facilitate the discovery of inappropriate access and assist in subsequent disciplinary or legal action.,SE
The EHRi must be capable of identifying all patients or persons whose records have been accessed or modified by a given user over a given period of time.,SE
The EHRi must provide functions for analyzing logs and audit trails to allow the identification of all users who have accessed or modified such record(s) over a given period of time.,SE
Rationale: This requirement greatly facilitates the determination of suspicious or wrongful use of access privileges with regard to patients who are high profile or whose confidentiality is otherwise especially at risk.,SE
"As noted in the discussion of Privacy Requirement 22a, the records of certain patients or persons (e.g. celebrities, politicians, and newsmakers) may be at elevated risk of access by those who do not have a need-to-know.",SE
"This requirement should not be construed as meaning that the information in the records of such patient or persons are somehow more confidential than those of ordinary citizens or that these records, as information assets, are more valuable than those that are not at elevated risk of inappropriate access.",SE
The EHRi must secure access to audit records and must safeguard access to system audit tools and audit trails to prevent misuse or compromise.,SE
"Confidentiality is critical since a third party obtaining access to such a log might infer PHI from audit log entries (e.g., from a log entry indicating update of a patient record by a user at a cancer care centre, it could be inferred that the patient has cancer).",SE
The EHRi must provide appropriate security measures to protect audit logs from tampering.,SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must subject system logs and audit logs to detailed review; on a regular and ongoing basis.,SE
"Note that analysis tools that facilitate audit trail review are mandated in Security Requirement 46, Security Requirement 47, Security Requirement 48 and Security Requirement 49.",SE
Audit log review can be greatly aided by software such as intrusion detection systems that look for unusual patterns of use and facilitate exception reporting.,SE
Note that Manitoba's health information legislation requires a trustee to regularly review audit trails -to detect any security breaches.,SE
5)detect unauthorized activities; and,SE
6)ensure information security when using mobile computing and tele-networking facilities.,SE
All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must develop an Access Control Policy for the EHRi.,SE
"a) the accurate capture of a user's identity (e.g.: Joan Smith, born March 26 1982, currently resident on Bloor Street, Toronto);",SE
"the accurate capture of a user's enduring professional credentials (e.g.: Dr. Joan Smith, Cardiologist) possibly and possibly job title (e.g.: Susan Jones, Medical Receptionist); and",SE
c) the proper assignment of a user id.,SE
All organisations connecting to the EHRi must subject potential users of POS systems that connect to the EHRi to a formal user registration process.,SE
"These user registration procedures must ensure: a) that the level of user identification that is provided is consistent with the assurance required, given the value of the information assets and the functions that will become available to the user; b) that each potential user has a legitimate relationship with the organisation; c) that each potential user has a legitimate need to access PHI via the EHRi.",SE
"All organisations connecting to the EHRi must ensure that users of POS systems that connect to the EHRi are assigned an identifier (user ID) that, in combination with other identifiers (e.g., facility identifiers, jurisdictional identifiers, etc.) can uniquely identify the user within the EHRi.",SE
POS systems must support the unique identification of users.,SE
Rationale: This requirement facilitates system-wide audit and trusted end-to-end security.,SE
"For the EHRi, the overarching objective is to provide security controls to ensure that access to specific records, and, where appropriate, to specific elements of PHI within those records, is granted only to those EHRi users with a legitimate need-to-know.",SE
"In the subsections that follow, several access control methodologies are discussed that, when taken together, ensure the confidentiality and integrity of PHI by restricting user access to those with a legitimate need-to-know.",SE
There are significant issues related to using RBAC to support an interoperable EHR that must be resolved before the EHRi can make full and effective use of RBAC.,SE
"All POS systems connected to the EHRi must ensure that each user will access applications and services of the EHRi in a single role (i.e., users who have been registered with more than one non-overlapping role must designate a single role during each EHRi session).",SE
"For example, a general practitioner who works in the Emergency Department of a rural hospital one day a week (and who has emergency override privileges while on duty) must clearly indicate to the POS system when she is acting in this capacity and must do so prior to accessing a patient or person's EHR via the EHRi.",SE
Another example would be an EHRi user accessing EHRi records as a clinician and also sometimes as a researcher.,SE
"A hierarchical organisation of roles, accommodating users who frequently switch between dual roles that are both related to clinical care, would greatly reduce user frustration from needlessly having to switch between one role and the other.",SE
"Properly designed roles will ensure that users rarely, if ever, have switch roles by initiating a new session.",SE
The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must be capable of assigning users to working groups and of granting access to records based on working groups.,SE
"At a minimum, VIPs and other selected patients will require restriction of their EHRs to just those individuals who are known members of their healthcare team.",SE
This is a privacy protective feature that all Canadians might reasonably expect to protect their PHI from potential access by any arbitrary healthcare provider registered to use the EHRi.,SE
"The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must support the revocation of user access privileges in a timely manner; i.e. to immediately prevent the user from logging on, after access privileges have been revoked.",SE
Revocation of user access privileges does not in itself alter the status of data that the user has already entered.,SE
Punitive revocation of a user's access privileges may need to be accompanied by a review of data entered by the user; such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.,SE
Rationale: This requirement ensures that user access privileges to the EHRi can be immediately and systematically suspended if there are grounds to do so.,SE
"Discretionary access control occupies a middle ground between the two extremes of, on the one hand, allowing all users in a given role access to a huge pool of electronic health records; and on the other hand, requiring explicit consent for each user to access each record.",SE
"As noted above, discretionary access control does not ""trump"" role based access control.",SE
"Organisations connecting to the EHRi must define user responsibilities, make users aware of them and have users agree to them as part of an acceptable use agreement.",SE
Rationale: Acceptable use agreements are an important part of ensuring that users are aware of their responsibilities (and hence help to support Security Requirement 16) as well as provide the basis for legal redress if users abuse their access rights.,SE
Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must ensure that all EHRi connections to remote servers and applications are authenticated.,SE
Rationale: This helps to ensure that applications containing PHI are not compromised by masquerading remote servers possibly and possibly applications.,SE
Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must securely control access to diagnostic ports and services on networks hosting those components.,SE
"Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must introduce network controls to segregate information services, users and information systems that are not involved in access to or hosting of the EHRi.",SE
Rationale: This requirement is intended to protect against a variety of denial of service attacks.,SE
"Organisations hosting components of the EHRi, must restrict and control the use of system utility programs.",SE
"Where appropriate, the EHRi should restrict connection duration to EHRi application services to provide additional security for access to those applications.",SE
Rationale: This requirement is sometimes used in high security applications to force a reconnect (and hence re-authentication) when a connection has been held open for an excessively long time.,SE
The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must robustly authenticate users.,SE
"Moreover, some level of uniformity in the strength of authentication will likely be needed to support cross-jurisdictional interoperability.",SE
It is important to note that this requirement would likely necessitate the implementation of robust authentication technologies:,SE
"It is expected that the EHRi and POS systems connected to the EHRi will work together to accomplish the task of authenticating users who access the EHRi; i.e., users do not need to be authenticated twice.",SE
"All POS systems connected to the EHRi must protect unattended workstations against an unauthorized person taking the opportunity to use the workstation while the POS is active, either with automatic timeout after a period of inactivity or by placing the workstations in a physically secure area.",SE
Proper positioning of workstations also plays a role in ensuring that the patients or persons cannot see the details of other people's records.,SE
"Rationale: Application of wireless networking to healthcare needs to be done securely to prevent interception and decryption of wireless network traffic and to protect against end-user masquerade, man-in-the-middle attacks, access point spoofing, session hijacking, and potentially denial of service.",SE
All of these can be addressed through the use of encryption.,SE
"This, combined with Security Requirement 31 (Encrypting PHI During Transmission) implies that all wireless communication of PHI be encrypted.",SE
1)ensure security is built into operational systems;,SE
"2)prevent loss, modification or misuse of user data in application systems;",SE
"3)protect the confidentiality, authenticity, availability and integrity of information;",SE
4)ensure IT projects and support activities are conducted in a secure manner; and,SE
5)maintain the security of application system software and data.,SE
b) must be capable of merging two or more EHR records if it is determined that multiple records for the same patient or person have been unintentionally created.,SE
"The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must include, wherever feasible, measures to safeguard against user error by validating data input to ensure that it is correct and appropriate.",SE
"All POS systems connected to the EHRi should ensure it is possible to check that hardcopy print-outs are complete (e.g.: ""page 3 of 5"").",SE
"To the extent that the EHRi supports the replacement of paper-based prescriptions, a facility for the application, recognition and verification of digital signatures will be among the services provided by the EHRi, as Canadian law requires that prescriptions be signed.77 Although the principle use of digital signatures would probably be for e-prescribing, there are many other less common situations where the signature of a physician might be required upon a form (for example, death certificates).",SE
Processing of these other paper based forms would also benefit from augmentation with e-forms and the concomitant use of digital signatures by physicians.,SE
"Finally, digital signatures play an important role in providing so-called ""security assertions"" -reliable attestations that a given user or system has a given attribute.",SE
"As well, digital signatures can themselves form the basis of an effective two-factor authentication methodology as per Security Requirement 71 (Robustly Authenticating Users), and so can fulfil this function as well as provide for signature capability.",SE
"Regulations under the Food and Drug Act require that prescriptions be either in writing or verbal: (a) if the prescription is in writing, it has been signed and dated by the practitioner issuing the same and the signature of the practitioner where not known to the pharmacist, has been verified by him; or (b)if the prescription is given verbally, the pharmacist has taken reasonable precaution to satisfy himself that the person giving the prescription is a practitioner.",SE
Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must take steps to test for and prevent the exploitation of published vulnerabilities in systems and software that host those component. Rationale: This requirement prevents the exploitation of known vulnerabilities in systems that have not been updated with currently available security patches.,SE
It also mandates that security patches which fix known security problems either be applied when available or else effective alternative steps be taken to address the security problem.,SE
Effective security vulnerability management of new or significantly upgraded systems and software should also include penetration testing.,SE
The objectives of security incident management are to: 1)build a reporting infrastructure for reporting incidents and weakness; and 2)manage incidents and institute improvements to prevent their future occurrence.,SE
The EHRi must - and all POS systems connected to the EHRi should -trigger a notification to the accountable person specified in Security Requirement 3 of every detected pattern of system misuse (see Security Requirement 46),SE
"Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must establish incident management responsibilities and procedures to ensure a quick, effective and orderly response to security incidents and to collect and preserve incident-related data such as audit trails, logs and other evidence.",SE
"Security incident management procedures are intended to restore normal EHRi operations in a timely manner, and to minimise any loss of confidentiality or data and system integrity.",SE
"Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must put in place a managed process for developing and maintaining business continuity throughout the organisation, including: a) developing a strategic plan, based on appropriate risk assessment, for the overall approach to business continuity; b) developing written plans to maintain or restore business operations in a timely manner following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes relating to the EHRi; and c) maintaining a unified framework of business continuity plans to ensure that all plans are consistent, and to identify priorities for testing and maintenance.",SE
Item c is intended to integrate business continuity planning in IT systems with broader plans to maintain services to patients.,SE
"The objectives of compliance in information security management are to: 1)avoid breaches of any criminal or civil law, statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations and of any security requirements; 2)ensure compliance of systems with organisational security policies and standards; and 3)maximize the effectiveness of and minimize interference with or from the system audit process.",SE
Audit standards for the EHRi will be based on jurisdictional requirements and standards.,SE
"7)Substitute Decision Makers May Require Identification Substitute decision makers may be required to make decision concerning treatment, as well to make decisions concerning the patient or person's consent directives.",SE
9)Keeping PHI from System and Administrative Personnel EHRi system administrators may have access to PHI that they are not authorized to retrieve; either directly via system tools other than the application level user interface or via integration engines that process and exchange information.,SE
"An EHRi that effectively encrypts such PHI during storage and when in transit could avoid these unintended disclosures to system personnel and other insiders (albeit with attendant overhead in administration and processing) but there are many other options as well, including decoupling of personal identifiers from healthcare information.80",SE
"10)Keeping PHI from Unauthorized Third Parties Unauthorized third parties may retrieve or even alter PHI in transit (e.g., by intercepting unencrypted transmission of data), in repositories (e.g., by ""hacking"" into database repositories), or in storage on secondary media (e.g., by obtaining unencrypted data backups or data archives).",SE
"This ensures that a user who does not work exclusively in an emergency department will not have access to emergency override functions while working in a non-emergency setting (e.g., when providing family medicine in a physician practice).",SE
-Security Requirement 43 specifies that the role exercised by the user while performing an action (e.g.: accessing or updating a record) must be logged in an audit trail.,SE
Users whose roles include a role with access to emergency override functions and who invokes that role in a non-emergency situation in order to exercise those emergency override functions may therefore be subject to disciplinary procedures based upon the evidence provided by the audit log.,SE
"All users are registered and uniquely identified (c.f. Security Requirement 54 and Security Requirement 55) and all organisations connecting to EHRi are also identified and their access logged as appropriate (Security Requirement 43 Minimum Content of Audit Logs), but there is no essential need "" from a privacy or security viewpoint "" to identify systems, servers or applications.",SE
The requirements for patient or person identification and the data used to support it may also vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.,SE
The provision of emergency care and other situations in which adequate patient identification may not have been possible will inevitably create instances of multiple records for the same patient or person.,SE
"Such merging requires the greatest care and will therefore necessitate not only personnel trained in such merging, but may also require technical tools to better facilitate the integration of information from the original records into a unified whole.",SE
"As EHRs become increasingly interoperable and the number of EHR users grows, so to does the risk of inappropriate access.",SE
"Whenever a request to retrieve a patient or person's EHR is initiated from a jurisdiction where a patient or person has not received care in the past, some additional authorization mechanisms may need to be invoked.",SE
"The specifics of this issue is not addressed by any of the requirements, although Privacy Requirement 8, Privacy Requirement 9, Privacy Requirement 10, Privacy Requirement 11, and Privacy Requirement 12 specify that consent data be captured by POS systems and transmitted to the EHRi when transmitting the underlying PHI.",SE
"Encryption technology is now routinely applied to network traffic to protect its passage across networks such as the Internet86, The enduring confidentiality of PHI and the low cost of storing huge volumes of intercepted network traffic combine to place stringent demands on the cryptographic protection of PHI during transmission.",SE
It will also require consistent policies and procedures for issuing digital certificates that meet the high standards of digital certificate issuance demanded of e-prescribing.,SE
Responsibilities must be carefully delineated so that the entire EHRi remains continuously defended against intrusion.,SE
User authentication schemes (and other security mechanisms that users are exposed to) must not become a barrier to deployment and use.,SE
"2) VLER DAS sends a list of available exam results filtered by Physician Name and Date Range to the consuming application (first pass) for the following allowed configurations: a. Last Name, Date Range; b. Last Name, First Name, Date Range; c. Last Name, First Name, Middle Name, Date Range;",SE
"Therefore, a maximum results limitation must be included in order to prevent VLER DAS from being overwhelmed.",SE
1) MVI (Master Veteran Index) will be the only system used by the DAS (Data Access Service) for any identity management function.,SE
"As the Business Owner, I want the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Data Access Services (DAS) to log all requests or responses that it receives or sends in relation to storage of an exam result so that VLER DAS is in compliance with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system auditing requirements and can assist with troubleshooting.",SE
"The VA requires that system audit logs must record sufficient information to establish what events occurred, the sources, and outcomes of the events.",SE
Audit logging must be sufficient in detail to facilitate reconstruction of events if a compromise or malfunction is suspected or has occurred.,SE
All requests and responses for the store action must be logged in the audit log.,SE
"The events and outcomes associated with the specified exam result will be recorded in VLER DAS audit logs, and can be used to aid in tracking the exam result through the system.",SE
1) VLER DAS stores event descriptions in an audit log for a minimum of six (6) years.,SE
"2) VLER DAS stores the following attributes, when available, in an audit log: a) Unique Identifier for the exam result; b) Creation Date (Date, Time, and Time Zone); c) Date Status Modified (Date, Time, and Time Zone); d) System ID (Fully Qualified Domain Name); e) Transaction Type (description of action, e.g., Store); f) Organization Name the document is received from or sent to; g) Event Description (e.g.,refer to audit logging events below ); h) Patient ID (EDIPI, if not available then ICN, if neither available then SSN) , Assigning Authority, Assigning Facility;",SE

In the case of an unsuccessful completion exception processing outlined in the On-line Exception Processing section is performed,MN
Contain the latest transaction count and amount of batches that have not been deleted from the POS device by the merchant or merchant acquirer,FR
Contain the details of a transaction between the initialize command for that transaction and the initialize command for the next transaction,FR
Ensure that each batch of transactions is cleared and settled once and only once,FT
Send transactions to card issuers or their processors in a standard format defined in agreement with the scheme provider,FR
Send transactions to other processors in a standard format defined in agreement with the scheme provider,FR
If a supported scheme provider has a dispute resolution process participate in that dispute resolution process with connecting processors to resolve any issues related to invalid transactions. These resolution processes should include a mechanism for repayment of funds associated with invalid transactions,O
Payment for a transaction is only required when a detail transaction is submitted for payment A merchant acquirer may choose to pay the merchant using the batch total,FR
The timing of payment to the merchant must be established between the merchant and the merchant acquirer,O
The CEP card sends a response to the reversal command to the POS device. The reversal is considered to be successful even in the event of a negative response or no response from the CEP card,FR
After the CEP card is inserted in the POS device the POS device initiates the cancel last purchase transaction,FR
If the POS device supports multiple applications or multiple transaction types an interaction between the terminal and consumer or sales agent determines the CEP application and the function to be performed (cancel last purchase transaction),FR
The batch is sent to the merchant acquirer. Delivery may involve transmission to multiple intermediate locations or it may be direct to the merchant acquirer,FR
The merchant acquirer validates the batch to ensure that it has been transmitted correctly and enters it into the log,FR
If the business rules allow this transaction is to be aggregated the PSAM must determine if it has an aggregation record for the card issuer. If the PSAM does not have an aggregation record for the card issuer a new aggregation record for the card issuer must be created,FR
The aggregated totals by card issuer must be transmitted to the merchant acquirer at the same time and manner as the non-aggregated detail transactions in the batch,FR
After investigation if the merchant acquirer decides based on scheme rules to accept the transactions a method must exist to settle them and forward them to the card issuer,O
A transaction that passes merchant acquirer validations and is forwarded to the card issuer is paid for by the card issuer. If the transaction does not pass card issuer validations the card issuer may follow the scheme provider's dispute procedures,FR
POS transactions that were rejected for payment by the merchant acquirer are flagged with an error code indicating the type of validation failure and are forwarded to the card issuer for CEP card history information only,FR
Card issuers must inform their cardholders as to which currencies they support in electronic purses,L
The CEP application must contain data that indicates the presence of a linked financial institution. If a linked financial institution is established for the CEP application then linked loads must be allowed and data in the application must indicate whether linked loads are supported,FR
Flexibility is required to accommodate the variety of environments where unlinked loads may be implemented. As a result the design specification must not preclude dual-leg transactions** from taking place either sequentially or in parallel. The design of a given implementation will vary depending on the device host and network capabilities,PO
Unload and currency exchange transactions are optional for CEP card issuers. The CEP card must indicate whether the card issuer supports these transactions. However if a card issuer issues multi-currency capable cards it must provide its cardholder with a facility to remove any remaining value. As a result if a card issuer supports loading of multiple currencies onto a card then it must support the unload or currency exchange transaction or both,LF
The card issuer must establish its policies for assigning and adjusting slot maximum balances. These policies may require the card issuer to maintain a card database,MN
"Currency exchange rate fluctuations may increase the card issuers liability. The card issuer must be able to adjust maximum balances to bring them in line with their policies. The card issuer may update the maximum balances as part of a load a partial unload and a currency exchange transaction. On a currency exchange transaction only the ""to"" currency maximum balance may be updated",L
A CEP card may contain currencies that the load acquirer does not support. As a result load devices must use the alphabetic issuer-supplied currency code and currency exponent from the CEP slot(s) to display the source amounts for the currency conversion transaction,FR
Card issuers must provide an alphabetic currency code in each message that establishes a new currency. This alphabetic currency code and the currency exponent will be used by the load device to display currency balances. This allows the cardholder to identify the currency being displayed,FR
Script messages that conform to EMV specifications may be included as part of load unload and currency exchange messages from the card issuer to the CEP card. An update key must be used when card parameters are changed. Script messages may be sent to the CEP card either before or after the credit for load debit of unload and currency exchange commands,FR
All on-line messages must have the ability to include card issuer discretionary data from the CEP card,FR
The card issuer must notify the cardholder if the assessment of service fees by the card issuer during the currency exchange transaction may result in a balance of zero after the transaction has completed,FR
The card issuer must have the ability to deactivate a CEP application in the response to a load or currency exchange transaction,FR
"The CEP card may support multiple currencies. Each currency occupies a ""slot"" within the CEP. The slots are defined by the currency supported. The currency for an individual slot is determined during load or currency exchange. Currency exchange could apply to a single slot and then only for the total balance",FR
It is a card issuer's decision to determine the currencies that are allowed to occupy slots in the CEP card. This decision is made by the card issuer during the load or currency exchange transaction by approving or rejecting the request to authorize the transaction,FR
A single currency cannot occupy more than one slot. The CEP card must not permit a slot to be assigned a currency if another slot in the CEP card has already been assigned to that currency,FR
The CEP card limits each slot to a maximum balance. The maximum balance for a slot is established when a currency is assigned to the slot and is determined externally by the card issuer or by CEP card data which indicates a maximum balance in a reference currency. There is no requirement that all slot maximums have the same relative value and there is no requirement for the card to maintain a maximum total value,FR
Expired cards must not be used for loading electronic value,FR
The time period during which a cardholder can unload electronic value perform a purchase or a currency exchange from an expired card may be determined by each issuer,FR
Consumers must be able to load electronic value to their cards at any participating load device regardless of the location provided that the currency that is requested is supported by the acquirer and the card issuer,FR
Load devices that are available to the general public should support multiple sources of funding and support both linked and unlinked loads,FR
The architecture for the electronic purse should not preclude the eventual deployment of a variety of devices to meet the needs of many card acceptance environments. Unload must not be precluded from being supported on any or all of these devices at the option of the acquirer,FR
